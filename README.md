# Sunnee – Sustainable Beachwear (TypeScript Project)

This project models the operational structure of **Sunnee**, a sustainable beachwear brand that produces garments using recycled marine plastic.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate how **TypeScript**, through interfaces and classes, can be used to represent real-world entities such as products, customers, and sustainable production processes.

## Project Overview

Sunnee is a hypothetical but realistic brand focused on:
- Sustainable fashion
- Recycled plastic materials
- Ethical and transparent production processes

The system models:
- Beachwear products
- Customers
- Sustainable production workflows

---

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Interfaces and Classes

---

## Project Structure

The project is composed of the following files:

- `interfaces.ts`  
  Defines the contracts for products, customers, and production processes.

- `Prodotto.ts`  
  Implements the beachwear product logic and customer assignment.

- `Cliente.ts`  
  Represents customers and handles product ordering.

- `Processoproduzione.ts`  
  Models a sustainable production process and manages products in production.

- `main.ts`  
  Contains the test logic that instantiates products, customers, and production processes.

## Core Features

- Creation of sustainable beachwear products
- Customer ordering system
- Product availability management
- Sustainable production process modeling
- Console-based output to demonstrate system behavior
